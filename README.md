# pipelined-datapath
Verilog 4-stage, 32 bit pipelined datapath

This is a hierarchical design for a pipelined data path using a register file and an ALU. It is designed to take 32 bit MIPS instructions. 
The registers are simulated using DFFs paramatrized to handle 32 bits.
The design is entirely with behavioral verilog.
